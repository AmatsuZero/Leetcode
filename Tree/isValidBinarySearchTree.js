/*
Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

1. The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
2. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
3. Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
